## Introduction
Social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook have revolutionized communication, enabling users to share content and engage with others instantly. With millions of posts generated daily, understanding social media engagement has become a critical task for businesses, marketers, and researchers looking to optimize their content strategy.

In this project, we analyze a simulated social media dataset containing user interactions, specifically focusing on likes across different content categories. By leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover trends in engagement and identify the types of content that resonate most with audiences.

Through this project, we will gain insights into:

- The distribution of likes across different content categories.
- The most popular categories based on user engagement.
- Statistical trends that can inform content optimization strategies for better reach and interaction.

## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze social media engagement trends by exploring a dataset of user-generated content. We will achieve this by:

1. Cleaning and processing the dataset to remove missing values and ensure data integrity.
2. Visualizing user engagement trends using histograms and boxplots to understand how likes vary across different content categories.
3. Performing statistical analysis to compute key metrics such as the average number of likes and category-specific engagement levels.
4. Drawing data-driven insights to help inform strategies for increasing engagement in various content types.

By the end of this project, we will have a deeper understanding of what drives user interactions on social media and how data analysis can be leveraged to improve content performance.

## Scope of the Project
The dataset we are working with simulates tweets or social media posts, each belonging to a specific content category (e.g., Food, Travel, Fashion, Music, etc.) with a corresponding number of likes. Our analysis will focus on:

Understanding how likes are distributed across different categories.
Identifying which categories receive the most engagement.
Performing statistical calculations to gain quantitative insights.
Generating visual representations of the data to highlight trends.
This project will not only reinforce data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis skills but also provide real-world insights into how data-driven decisions can enhance content strategies on social media platforms.
